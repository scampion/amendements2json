has been slow to react and adapt – politically, diplomatically and militarily – to new crises and to this new international context; considers that, in the specific area of defence a political reluctance to implement to the fullest extent the robust provisions provided for in the European treaties and the numerous cooperation arrangements between Member States have weakened the Union’s ability to play a decisive role in external crises; therefore urges the European Council to move from unanimity to qualified majority voting in the fields of CFSP and CSDP where the Treaty on European Union allows it, including on decisions on CSDP civilian missions; recognises, further, that no country is able by itself to address the security challenges on the European continent and in its immediate environment;\\n\\nOr. <Original>{EN}en</Original>\\n\\n</Amend>\\n\\n<Amend>Amendment\\t\\t<NumAm>7</NumAm>\\n\\n<RepeatBlock-By><Members>Mairead

recalls that the 2013 Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union states that “a particularly serious cyber incident or attack could constitute sufficient ground for a Member State to invoke the EU Solidarity Clause (article 222 TFEU); reminds that the Council Decision 2014/415/EU ‘on the arrangements for the implementation by the Union of the solidarity clause’, establishes that the solidarity clause calls for the Union to mobilise all the instruments at its disposal, including the structures developed in the framework of the CSDP; calls on Member States to consider the activation of the solidarity clause in the future;\\n\\nOr. <Original>{EN}en</Original>\\n\\n</Amend>\\n\\n</RepeatBlock-Amend>\\n\\n\\n\\n<PathFdR>AM\\\\1192832EN.docx</PathFdR>\\t\\tPE<NoPE>643.190</NoPE><Version>v02-00</Version>\\n\\nEN\\tUnited in diversity\\tEN\\n\\nPE<NoPE>643.190</NoPE><Version>v02-00</Version>\\t4/25\\t<PathFdR>AM\\\\1192832EN.docx</PathFdR>\\n\\nEN\\n\\n<PathFdR>AM\\\\1192832EN.docx</PathFdR>\\t3/25\\tPE<NoPE>643.190</NoPE><Version>v02-00</Version>\\n\\n\\t\\tEN\""
